# GuruDome Monetization Strategies

A brainstorm of potential revenue models for the GuruDome platform.

---

## 🎯 Freemium Model

| Tier | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Free** | Basic guru search, view ratings, read limited reviews |
| **Premium ($X/mo)** | Full review history, detailed analytics, "scam risk" scores, early access to new gurus, bookmark/follow gurus |

---

## 💎 Verified Guru Badges

Charge gurus a fee to apply for a **"Verified Expert"** badge after passing a vetting process. This creates:
- A revenue stream from gurus wanting credibility
- Trust signals for users
- Quality control for the platform

---

## 📊 B2B / Enterprise

- **API Access**: Let other platforms (investment apps, course marketplaces) integrate guru trust scores
- **Brand Safety Reports**: Companies hiring influencers can pay for background/reputation reports

---

## 🎓 Lead Generation / Affiliate

- Partner with **legitimate** course platforms or financial services
- When users find a trusted guru, offer affiliate links to their courses/products
- Revenue share on conversions

---

## 📢 Advertising (Tasteful)

- **Sponsored Placements**: Gurus can pay to be featured (clearly labeled)
- **Banner Ads**: Targeted ads from relevant brands
- Keep it minimal to preserve trust

---

## 🏆 Premium Content

- Deep-dive reports on specific gurus or niches
- "Scam Alert" newsletter subscription
- Exclusive community access (Discord, forum)

---

## 🤔 Key Decisions to Make

1. Do you want gurus to pay, users to pay, or both?
2. How important is it to stay completely unbiased (some models like guru badges could create conflicts)?
3. What's the primary growth focus right now – users or content?
